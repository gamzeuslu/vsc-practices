Macros and Preprocessor directives

#define MAX 100

#undef  MAX

If MAX is redefined with a different value this is an undefined behaviour.
If MAX is defined previously (i.e in a header file) first undefine the macro then redefine it.

Macros aren't block-bound. Even if a macro is defined within a block, it's still valid outside the block.
Preprocessor doesn't care about blocks. However, if the same macro is undefined within the same block, this creates a pseudo-scope.
